# Epicodus Track Sorting Hat

#### This is a webpage that takes user input to determine what track they should consider at Epicodus, 02/17/2017

#### By Stormi Hoebelheinrich

## Description

The website contains several forms. The primary form asks questions about the user to determine what Epicodus track the user should take. Based on the response, as long as the user has entered their first name, the screen will print the results in the right panel. Under the primary form and results panel, there is a second form. This form asks the user to select a language they would like to take a quiz on. Based on the selected language, the user is given a simple true false question. When they submit the answer, a result will print at the bottom of the screen.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

## Known Bugs

The program runs well. I had some issues with giving some classes logical names, but it does function.
